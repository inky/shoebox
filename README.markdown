Silly little applications made with [Shoes][oneshoe],
for Casey Kolderup’s [Two Shoes Weekend][twoshoes].

1. **Butt-Touches** is about touching butts.
   Based on [a comic][butts] by Ryan Pequin.

2. **News In Bed** fetches headlines from BBC News
   and makes them more exciting in bed.

3. **Doomsday Clock** checks thebulletin.org for an estimate on how close the
   world is to global disaster. (At the time of writing, [the clock][doomsday]
   has changed a grand total of three times this millennium.)

4. **Cannon** is a cannon. It doesn’t work well.
